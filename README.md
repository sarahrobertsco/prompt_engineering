# The Art of Prompt Engineering

Welcome to my guide to Prompt Engineering ðŸ‘‹ â€” what I love is that prompt engineering is the sweet spot between linguistics, psychology, and artificial intelligence. This repository is a living document, suitable for both aspiring prompt engineers and seasoned professionals looking to deepen their expertise.

## About Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering is an emerging discipline that focuses on designing inputs that elicit the desired output from AI models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI. As I write this, it's not quite a year (360 days) since [OpenAI released a ChatGPT demo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/19/a-short-history-of-chatgpt-how-we-got-to-where-we-are-today/?sh=3f683769674f) and yet conversational AI and advanced language models have become ubiquitous, the role of a prompt engineer is becoming pivotal in shaping the interactions between humans and machines.
