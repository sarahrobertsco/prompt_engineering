# Addressing Bias and Fairness in Prompt Engineering

AI models can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in their training data. This guide provides insights on identifying and mitigating bias in prompt engineering.

## Understanding AI Bias

- AI models reflect the biases in the data they were trained on.
- Biased prompts can reinforce stereotypes and lead to unfair outcomes.

## Strategies for Bias Mitigation

### Diverse Data Sources
- Use training data from a variety of sources to represent different perspectives.
- The more diverse the data, the less biased the AI modelâ€™s responses will be.

### Regular Audits
- Conduct periodic audits of your prompts and the AI's responses.
- Look for patterns that might indicate bias.

### Inclusive Language
- Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all groups.
- Avoid terms and phrases that could be seen as discriminatory or exclusive.

## Example: Mitigating Bias

- Biased Prompt: "Describe the typical CEO."
- Unbiased Prompt: "Describe the role and responsibilities of a CEO in a modern corporation."
